Information Architecture Description The information architecture of this system outlines how users interact with a data platform built on IMDb metadata. Users access a web-based interface or application that communicates with a backend server. This server handles incoming queries, performs filtering or joins across multiple tables, and returns results from a relational database.

The IMDb dataset—composed of multiple TSV files—is cleaned, transformed, and loaded into this backend system. Once processed, the data supports search functionality such as finding top-rated movies by genre, browsing a director’s filmography, or comparing rating trends over time. Users may have stored preferences (e.g., favorites or past queries) to personalize their experience. All user queries are handled securely with read-only access.
